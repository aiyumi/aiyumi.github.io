I updated my profile page (the "[About](en/about)" page). I forgot to mention that I got a job, which is an important fact.

The blog turns two this month (congratulations to it, and a big zero for me for the lack of updates :P), and since it started, guess how many comments I got that weren't spam. Only two! And both are from friends I know personally! ... Keeping comments active aren't worth the trouble... So, I decided to disable comments. The easiest way to contact me is still my [email](en/contact).
