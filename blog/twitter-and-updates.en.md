It may not seem like it, but a lot happened after my last post:

* I did an arrangement of another music from Pokemon Black & White. It's the music titled "Ghetsis' Ambitions". Listen & download [here][yt-ambitions] or [here][gb-ambitions].

* Probably this is where I'm most active at the moment. I never mentioned it here before, but for some time now, I've been writing a Pokemon Black & White fan fiction (in English). It's called [Soul Link][pokemon-sl], and I'm silently updating it regularly.

* I did an audio drama adaptation of a scene from said fan fiction. The fanfic is in English, but the audio drama is in Japanese. The dialogue is mostly the same as the one from the fan fiction, so for those who understood the scene in the fic, the Japanese drama can probably be understood as well. A few people who like watching anime with Japanese audio might like it... Or not :P. Anyway, it can be found [here][true-plans]. It also uses the music arrangement I just mentioned.

* I uploaded a few more sounds to [Freesound][myfreesound]. I also added a lot of interesting sounds from other people to my [bookmarks][fsbookmarks].

* I finally got around to organizing my SlackBuilds for compiling Orca under Slackware and [uploaded them to Github][slackbuilds].

    Edit (2013-09-27): instructions on how to use the scripts now can be found [here][orca-install].

* I bought a 3DS XL. I wasn't thinking on doing that yet, but once again, I found a cheap one (for Brazil standards), and since prices in general are rising due to inflation, I decided to do it before it got too expensive. I won't make a full review like I did with the other one, but it suffices to say that compared to the normal 3DS, the buttons are more comfortable, the console is easier to hold (though a bit heavier) and the battery lasts more.

* In mid July, my internet connection stayed down for nearly two weeks, affecting my work and everything. Calling the ISP only resulted in pointless excuses most of the time, and it took very long for them to have the will to send a technician here and fix it. It was a problem affecting the whole region where I live. Hopefully it's sorted out now.

* Recently, I've been listening a lot of Japanese music which uses singing synthesis software like [VOCALOID][voca-en] and [UTAU][uta-en].

Well, a lot happened, as you can see. The problem is that I don't have the patience to write a full blog post for each thing I do, let alone in three languages... And I realized: isn't that the purpose of a microblog like Twitter? Right now, my Twitter isn't seeing much use aside from automatically alerting when I post something here. I'm thinking of making it update (preferably automatically) whenever I publish a fanfic chapter, or a Youtube video and maybe a few other things, so people can know I'm still active even if this blog isn't updated so often. The account is "[@aiyumi_en][twitter-en]". You can follow me, or if you're like me and aren't much into these social network things, you can use this [RSS feed][twitter-rss].
