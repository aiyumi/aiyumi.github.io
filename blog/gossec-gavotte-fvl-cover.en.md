In my [previous post](/en/blog/virtual-violins), I wrote how I chose the [Embertone Friedlander Violin][friedlanderhp] virtual instrument to try to fill my violin sound needs, and how I got it to run on Linux. I'm feeling like the protagonist of the anime/game series Kin'iro no Corda (also known as La Corda d'Oro), who is given a magical violin that anyone can play! To "celebrate," I decided to make arrangements of the music featured in the series (mostly classical music), and today I bring you my first one: the "Gavotte" by Fran√ßois Joseph Gossec.
