Those who have read my [other](/en/blog/gossec-gavotte-fvl-cover) [posts](/en/blog/virtual-violins) probably noticed that I'm currently obsessed with violins. It turns out that I couldn't resist and, in march of 2015, I began taking lessons to learn to play the real thing!

Three months have passed, and I continue my [arrangements of the song "We Are the Three Bonne Brothers"](/en/blog/bonnes-theme-arrange-1) from Rockman DASH/Mega Man Legends. Today I bring a few more versions, this time with violins, both the virtual one and the real one!

These where made for my fan fiction, "[Trigger of Change][fftoc]," where the Servbots learn to play the violin. The piano is the same as the ["Marimbonnes" version](/en/blog/bonnes-theme-arrange-1).

First, the virtual one, made with the Embertone Friedlander Violin VST.

And this is my attempt at playing it with a real violin. Warning: beginner level playing (just three months of taking weekly lessons), and the intonation is still quite off. Also, it's my first time trying to record an acoustic instrument (recorded with a Zoom H4n portable recorder).

Three violins version: until I arrived at the final result above, I had to record the song over twenty times! I didn't want so many takes to go to waste, so I selected the better three of my recording (mis)takes and glued them together. The result is a trio of clumsy and out of tune Servbots.

Three violins + Friedlander Violin version: the "trio" above playing along with the virtual one.
