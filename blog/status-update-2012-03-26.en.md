It's been a long time since the last post. Almost three months! I didn't forget the blog, just couldn't update it. I wrote that I wanted to post more this year, but it seems that 2012 had other plans for me. Good plans!

Early in January, I've (finally) got a job and since then I've been very busy. Just now I'm getting used to the new routine. It came suddenly, unexpectedly, but now I can "officially" say that I'm a programmer!

Before the job came, I was reading a lot about games and C++. And guess what language I'm working with!

"... Hm... C++?"

No! Wrong! The language is... Perl! :D

Very different, isn't it? Because of that, I thought I wouldn't be able to do anything right. Fortunately, I (too) was wrong. Everything is going well, although I still have a lot to learn. It was difficult at first, but I'm enjoying the work and am even thinking about using Perl for other things.

As for the blog, the same as always. I'll update when I can. I have several articles waiting to be finished. The problem lies in writting them in three languages...
