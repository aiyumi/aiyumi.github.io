I decided to do an arrangement of the song "Happy Birthday to You" for my music teacher's birthday and, after much struggling, [this][videolink] is what came out.

I played and recorded it on my keyboard (a Yamaha Motif XF), then used [SoX][sox-intro] to convert the file.

Speaking of conversion, you can download the file converted to OGG format [here][ogglink].
