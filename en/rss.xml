The plot is set in Japan and the game shows various aspects of Japanese culture. Among often featured events are scenes where the characters go out to eat ramen (a noodle-based dish that is very popular  in Japan) and takoyaki (roasted octopus dumpling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well... I have to admit that, despite being of Japanese descent, I had never eaten either ramen or takoyaki. The noodles-based dish I've known from my childhood is just udon (simple noodles) cooked in water with shoyu (soy sauce). The only thing with "ramen" in the name I had ever eaten was the instant noodles from Nissin Foods labeled as "instant ramen", but I guess this doesn't really count :P . I've always heard a lot about both ramen and takoyaki, but had never stopped to think about them. Only after playing Persona 3 I actually realized I had never eaten either of them! ... Yes, weird, but it's true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, my mother and I came across a ramen-ya (or ramen shop, a restaurant specializing in ramen) and decided to enter. We ordered the cheapest option, just to get a sense of what ramen tasted like. We got a large bowl of broth with noodles and seaweed flakes inside, and three very thin pork slices and a half boiled egg on top. Was it good? Yes, it was, but... not as much as I thought it should be. The taste didn't go much beyond the good ol' udon in shoyu, and left that impression that something wasn't quite right... I don't know if the people running the place are Japanese (the staff at least wasn't) and I don't know how close it gets to a ramen shop from Japan, but their food left much to be desired in my opinion. Even though we had ordered the simplest option, and even though I don't know how true ramen should taste like, I believe the acclaimed ramen is supposed to be something unique, on a different level, and not possible to simply be compared to udon hastily cooked in shoyu. After this frustration, I decided to leave the curiosity about ramen aside for the moment. Maybe another day, at a better restaurant ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forward to end of March 2016. I was writing a fan fiction about the aforementioned Persona 3. It was a scene featuring a Japanese food, and I decided to research about it to reduce the chances of writing wrong information. This research took me to a &lt;a href="http://www.japanesecooking101.com/"&gt;site with Japanese food recipes&lt;/a&gt; and, by chance, I stumbled upon their &lt;a href="http://www.japanesecooking101.com/ramen-recipe/"&gt;ramen recipe&lt;/a&gt;. Then, something unexpected happened. I don't know what got into me, and I had the crazy idea of trying to make ramen...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a problem right away. The recipe was in English, and, to my surprise, I found that cooking vocabulary was quite different from the "normal" vocabulary I was used to. Literal translations of verbs and ingredient names often make no sense in Portuguese (my native language), and I had to consult sites with Portuguese to English translations of cooking terms. Once I was able to decypher the terms, I could understand the recipe reasonably. It actually didn't seem that complicated, and yet I had the impression that it had the potential to turn out better than the ramen from that restaurant!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not much into cooking (my lack of will to cook, as well as my lack of ability in the kitchen partly because of my vision impairment, are some of my greatest worries), but since that crazy idea managed to get me motivated, I figured I'd try to take advantage of the situation. Who knows? Maybe if I get incentives to practice, I might end up learning to like cooking, or at least come to not dislike it so much...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can cut the ingredients (like vegetables) reasonably well, although it takes more time than it normally should. The biggest problem is to tame the beast called stove. Without the ability to see, I still don't know how to tell when things have cooked enough, for example. For now, my mother is helping me with the stove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, everything went fine as we followed the recipe, and our ramen got ready! Below is a picture of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-center" src="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/uploads/images/p3-food-ramen/my-ramen.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="A bowl of soup with noodles in the bottom, and a thick slice of pork, a half boiled egg and very thin pieces of green onions on top. Since our bowl is small and can't fit much inside, the noodles got hidden beneath the other things and hardly appears in the photo."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference from the recipe was that I didn't use the "angel hair pasta in baking soda" workaround that was meant to substitute for the Japanese noodles (I used fresh ramen noodles from our local Japanese grocery store ). Also, I didn't put moyashi (bean sprouts) on the topping because I don't like it much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, fortunately the ramen was to our liking. It was a bit of work but I think it was worth it. And yes, it turned out better than the one from the restaurant! I still don't know how real ramen is supposed to taste like, but according to visitors' comments on the recipe's page, some said the results reminded them of the ramen they had had in Japan. So, I'll consider this as a reasonable approximation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright. The ramen's done. Now, I need the takoyaki...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/p3-food-ramen/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 10 Apr 2016 23:30:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Brahms Lullaby on Violin</title><link>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/brahms-lullaby-violin-1/</link><dc:creator>Aiyumi</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 8th, 2016, marked one year since I began taking violin lessons, and I decided to write this post to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/flying-on-brahms-waltz"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I had mentioned the Brahms' lullaby. And it so happens that I've recently learned to play it on the violin. So, here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

The book only says that it's a waltz composed by Johannes Brahms, but in fact, its whole title is "Waltz Opus 39 Number 15". My homework was to describe what comes to mind when listening to this music. And I was supposed to let my imagination fly (nothing like, "The composer meant this, this and that"). So I let it fly. It flew through the roof, and towards the clouds (more on this below). I've always liked to imagine the songs I listen to as though they were the "background music" or the "soundtrack" for something, so it was an interesting experience. Here's the result (warning: ramblings of someone who has no classical music background whatsoever :P): &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/flying-on-brahms-waltz/"&gt;more…&lt;/a&gt; (3 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Audio</category><category>Violin</category><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/flying-on-brahms-waltz/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 21 Dec 2015 23:29:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Server Migration and Blog System Change</title><link>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/static-blog-migration/</link><dc:creator>Aiyumi</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the blog's visual didn't change much, it's core has changed drastically. Now it's a static blog, with only HTML pages and doesn't need PHP or a database anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why a Static Blog?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, static blogs work like this: I write posts in some markup language (I use &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;) in a text editor of my choice, then a generator program (usually command line-driven) transforms posts in HTML and combines them with layout templates of the page (header, menu, content etc.) and generates all HTML pages, which can be uploaded to any webserver. For me, writing on my favorite text editor and typing a few simple commands to generate and upload the pages is much more comfortable than struggling for hours with a heavy web interface full of JavaScript (the reason why I never got along with WordPress).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a while since I've been wanting to migrate to a static blog. I had tested several static blog generator programs, but none had exactly the features I wanted (mainly multilanguage content support). I had even started trying to program my own (in Perl), but in the end, I gave up. Then, this year (2015), I found this software called &lt;a href="https://getnikola.com/"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt; (which is written in Python). A few tests later, I concluded that it does everything I want (and then some), and decided that the time to migrate had come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;And Why the Server Change?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been hosting my sites at &lt;a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?362621"&gt;DreamHost&lt;/a&gt; since 2007 and never had any problems. Particularly, I rather like the &lt;a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/"&gt;great documentation available on their wiki&lt;/a&gt;, SSH access which enables uploading files via Rsync instead of FTP (basically, it's faster because Rsync sends only what is different between the files on my machine and the ones on the server, rather than reuploading everything all over again), the ability to install other software on the server (the wiki provides detailed instructions), the ability to edit PHP settings, among other things, and last but not least, their humorous monthly newsletters :P. Then why did I decide to change webhosts? For a few simple reasons: even though all of these features are interesting, over the years I discovered I don't need this much. I don't have as much time to develop sites as I had before, when I signed up for their service in 2007. At the time, I still didn't have a job, and believed I'd work designing sites. Then, I got a job as a Perl programmer, years passed and, in the end, the only site I've been able to maintain (more or less) actively is this one you're on right now, and it barely used PHP and MySQL. Now that the site is static, I don't even need PHP and MySQL anymore! And with the high US Dollar rates (one Dollar nearing four Brazilian Reals), the hosting plan is getting hard to afford, and it doesn't make much sense to keep paying for so many features I'm not using. That said, even if I don't use the service anymore, I still consider DreamHost's webhosting very good, and I recommend it to those who don't have problems with the Dollar rates :P , and need a webhost that supports MySQL, PHP (or Perl or Python which are also included in their plan) and SSH access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The domain registration for "warpstar.net" will still remain on DreamHost (not only because I like the included features like whoes privacy protection, but also because this serves as an excuse for me to keep receiving the humorous monthly newsletters :P *). But now, the blog is hosted on &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;, and the pages are uploaded via Git (which also only uploads the differences in the files rather than reuploading everything every time), and as a bonus, the site even got version control :D !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit: or so I had thought. The account cancel page says that if I cancel the hosting, even if I keep the domain registration, I won't get the newsletters anymore. Too bad... :(&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit (2016/03/04): apparently not! Despite what the cancel page said, I still keep receiving the newsletters :D !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons above are important to me, but... okay, enough rambling. In the end, what really matters to everyone else is that all the content is here, the URLs remain the same, and the site is still online. The conversion may not have been 100%. There might be a few bugs here and there, and I intend to correct them as I find them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Site Updates</category><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/static-blog-migration/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Dec 2015 18:11:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>An Introductory Video to CeVIO</title><link>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/ath-cevio-1/</link><dc:creator>Aiyumi</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've already mentioned here on the blog a few voice synthesizer software, like &lt;a href="http://espeak.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Espeak&lt;/a&gt; (which provides a voice to my screen reader program), the Japanese voice synthesizer &lt;a href="http://open-jtalk.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Open JTalk&lt;/a&gt; (which the Windows screen reader &lt;a href="http://www.nvaccess.org/"&gt;NVDA&lt;/a&gt; uses to read Japanese text), and the singing synthesis software VOCALOID, which I've been &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/accessibility-and-how-i-began-using-vocaloid"&gt;using for a while&lt;/a&gt;.

It begins introducing a few software that came first (MMDAgent and Open JTalk), then goes on to talk about the main topic, CeVIO. It demonstrates various voice samples (both for speech and for singing), and examples of how to edit the voices' parameters to read Japanese text. (it even has tips for those wanting to buy the software :D )&lt;/p&gt;

Capcom hasn't shown any interest in continuing the series, but a few days ago, a light at the end of the tunnel came from somewhere else. Comcept, the company founded by Keiji Inafune (Rockman / Mega Man series' creator, who had left Capcom) launched a project to create a series that will become the spiritual successor to DASH/Legends. The project is called "RED ASH." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/in-the-mood-to-redash/"&gt;more…&lt;/a&gt; (12 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Games</category><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/in-the-mood-to-redash/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jul 2015 18:12:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Rockman DASH - "We are the Three Bonne Brothers" Violin Arrangements</title><link>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/bonnes-theme-arrange-2/</link><dc:creator>Aiyumi</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who have read my &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/gossec-gavotte-fvl-cover"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/virtual-violins"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; probably noticed that I'm currently obsessed with violins. It turns out that I couldn't resist and, in march of 2015, I began taking lessons to learn to play the real thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three months have passed, and I continue my &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/bonnes-theme-arrange-1"&gt;arrangements of the song "We Are the Three Bonne Brothers"&lt;/a&gt; from Rockman DASH/Mega Man Legends. Today I bring a few more versions, this time with violins, both the virtual one and the real one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These where made for my fan fiction, "&lt;a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10564022/1/Trigger-of-Change"&gt;Trigger of Change&lt;/a&gt;," where the Servbots learn to play the violin. The piano is the same as the &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/bonnes-theme-arrange-1"&gt;"Marimbonnes" version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the virtual one, made with the Embertone Friedlander Violin VST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download/listen: &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.opendrive.com/files/101759890_xIo2h_d1b5/bonnes-fvl01.ogg"&gt;bonnes-fvl01.ogg (OpenDrive)&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.4shared.com/mp3/wxHz8p3Qba/bonnes-fvl01.html"&gt;bonnes-fvl01.mp3 (4shared)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is my attempt at playing it with a real violin. Warning: beginner level playing (just three months of taking weekly lessons), and the intonation is still quite off. Also, it's my first time trying to record an acoustic instrument (recorded with a Zoom H4n portable recorder).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download/listen: &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.opendrive.com/files/101759900_0s6x3_4a1d/bonnes-realviolin01.ogg"&gt;bonnes-realviolin01.ogg (OpenDrive)&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.4shared.com/mp3/MJN7Xw8xce/bonnes-realviolin01.html"&gt;bonnes-realviolin01.mp3 (4shared)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three violins version: until I arrived at the final result above, I had to record the song over twenty times! I didn't want so many takes to go to waste, so I selected the better three of my recording (mis)takes and glued them together. The result is a trio of clumsy and out of tune Servbots.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm feeling like the protagonist of the anime/game series Kin'iro no Corda (also known as La Corda d'Oro), who is given a magical violin that anyone can play! To "celebrate," I decided to make arrangements of the music featured in the series (mostly classical music), and today I bring you my first one: the "Gavotte" by François Joseph Gossec.&lt;/p&gt;

Partly because I don't play very well :P, and also because the violin sounds of the keyboard are horrible. Wondering if the problem was only with my instrument or was common to keyboards in general, I decided to check the state of the sampled solo violin sounds available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Commercial Sample Libraries&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not a specialist by any means, but I found most of the commercial solo violin samples to be very disappointing. Even the ones from extremely expensive sound libraries (over 1000 dollars) leave much to be desired in my opinion. To me, they are so bad that it bothers me. No matter how simple the played part is, the timbre isn't smooth. It's weird, as if something was missing from the sound. And it isn't even the obvious lack of emotion (of course there's that too, but that's another story), it's something else. I don't know how to explain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the demos that I heard are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.soundsonline.com/QL-Solo-Violin"&gt;EWQL (East West Quantum Leap) Solo Violin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4K3T_mPjh8"&gt;Garritan Stradivari Solo Violin&lt;/a&gt; (discontinued). it's passable but still bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/dcuny/gpo-solo-violin-test"&gt;solo violin&lt;/a&gt; from the orchestral library &lt;a href="http://www.garritan.com/products/personal-orchestra-4/"&gt;Garritan Personal Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;. I heard that it's based on samples from the Stradivary Violin mentioned above, but it's much more limited, and you can easily notice that the quality is much worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/alucinari/update-to-bach-sonata-vsl"&gt;solo violin&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="http://www.vsl.co.at/en/211/261/2064/2067/1751.htm"&gt;Vienna Symphonic Library Special Edition&lt;/a&gt; orchestral library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/dcuny/violin-test"&gt;solo violin&lt;/a&gt; from the orchestral package &lt;a href="http://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/philharmonik/"&gt;Miroslav Philharmonik&lt;/a&gt; isn't that bad, considering that the sample library (including instruments for the whole orchestra) actually isn't very expensive (the full package costs less than 200 dollars)! And I also read that it can run on Linux through Wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Free Sample Libraries&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the free options, I found the collection of &lt;a href="http://slib.soundex.co.uk/index.php?instrument=violin"&gt;violin samples from Philharmony.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;. These have various articulations, but are in MP3 format, meaning that they suffer from quality loss, so they aren't suitable to be used for anything too serious. Another disadvantage is the license, which disallows distribution of the samples (be it for free or otherwise) the samples individually or in the form of "virtual instruments" (for example, you can't create a SF2 or SFZ file  from them and put it for download). The license allows use of the samples in commercial works, but with the quality loss caused by the MP3 compression, who's going to do that anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There're also &lt;a href="http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MISviolin.html"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MISviolin2012.html"&gt;these (recorded in 2012 and a bit better)&lt;/a&gt; samples from the University of Iowa. They are also in AIF format, include various articulations and, unlike the previous ones, they can be used without restrictions. The problems are that the notes aren't separated into individual files, and specially in the first version, several of them aren't sustained steadily or have a bit "scratchy" sound...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are the &lt;a href="http://www.freesound.org/people/ldk1609/packs/"&gt;violin samples by Ldk1609&lt;/a&gt;. To be honest, I think that these have a better timbre than the commercial libraries mentioned. They are in AIF format, so it's possible to convert them to WAV, create an SFZ file (an open sound library format) to map the audio files to MIDI notes and use, for example, in &lt;a href="http://www.linuxsampler.org/"&gt;LinuxSampler&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems that work for creating a SFZ is &lt;a href="http://www.linuxmusicians.com/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;amp;t=12530"&gt;ongoing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And (just for sake of completeness) there's &lt;a href="http://sso.mattiaswestlund.net/"&gt;Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;, available in SFZ format. Actually, it's a collection of free orchestral instrument sound samples. The solo violins are the same free ones mentioned previously, but unfortunately they are drenshed in reverb (urgh)...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Embertone Friedlander Violin&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a commercial library that I found when I wasn't looking for virtual violins. I was reading a thread while searching for something unrelated, and it mentioned this library. The thread had no link to the official page, but I decided to see if there was any demo on Youtube. I found &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisOROAI0oc"&gt;this video demonstrating the features&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7akUpXOHZoQ"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ats-RNfU8Yc"&gt;official&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVkvo9wK-_M"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt;. I loved the sound right away. I thought, "A good instrument like this one probably costs thousands of dollars!" Google brought me the &lt;a href="http://embertone.com/instruments/friedlanderviolin.php"&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt; and I was stunned after listening to the demos... And checking the price... less than $150...! I wanted it so badly! What held me from buying it was the fact that it is an instrument for Kontakt (also compatible with the free version, Kontakt Player). The problem is that I googled about running Kontakt 5 on Linux and found nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a year later, by mid-2014, a &lt;a href="http://linux-audio.4202.n7.nabble.com/Recommended-near-realistic-strings-section-generator-td91020.html"&gt;thread appeared on the Linux-audio-user mailing list&lt;/a&gt; about recommendations of orchestral sounds on Linux, where one of the members said that he used Kontakt instruments on Linux via Wine. So I asked for more information and decided to try. Right at that time, an &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5JRW3Oyy3k&amp;amp;list=UUOP3cfW8rXbZ7vor2XUhj-w"&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; and a sale  for the Friedlander Violin came about, and I decided it was time and purchased it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, I was faced with an obstacle. Downloading the program required the use of a proprietary download manager app called Continuata Connect, where you enter the serial code gotten when purchasing the product and the software brings the files from that code (the direct links don't appear, meaning that the download can't be done via browser, Wget, Curl, ...). I tried running Continuata on Wine. It only ran in Windows XP mode. If I set Wine to "Windows 7," the program didn't even run and said that it had encountered a serious problem and couldn't start. The program ran with Wine disguised as XP, but that wasn't enough. It didn't work properly. The download always hung, the file parts got corrupted and deleted, then everything started all over again. In the end, I ended up installing the Continuata thing on my Windows partition just to download the library, and it worked with no problems on Windows (miracles happen :P). I moved the downloaded files to the Linux partition soon after, though. I don't know what causes this problem under Wine, but after a little research, I found out that other virtual instrument developers provide direct links to users who have problems with Continuata, or that can't download for whatever reason. I don't know if Embertone also does this. I didn't ask them since I had already downloaded everything, but it may be worth asking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kontakt Player installed on Wine just fine. I had some trouble setting Kontakt up, but it was related to my screen reader (software that speaks all the text on the screen, mostly used by visually impaired people to access the computer) taking over the soundcard and ALSA. People with standard setups (I.E. almost everyone else) probably won't run into this problem (but if you want more details, you can read everything that happened on &lt;a href="http://linux-audio.4202.n7.nabble.com/Embertone-Friedlander-Violin-on-Linux-was-Re-Recommended-near-realistic-strings-section-generator-td91163.html"&gt;this thread on the Linux-Audio-User mailing list&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instrument is a "Powered by Kontakt Player" library, and needs to be registered through the "Add Library" button. This button is also present in Kontakt's VST interface, but it doesn't work (it prompts you for choosing the directory where the library is installed, but gives a "No library found" error. I don't know if that also happens on Windows). You must use the standalone Kontakt to add and activate the library (you need to do it just once). After added and activated though, the instrument also appears in the VST interface and works normally. I can use it with Dssi-VST and record the output in Ecasound with no problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, I was afraid of buying the Friedlander Violin, then not being able to make it work. If that happened, my last resort would be to use it on Windows, like I'm doing with VOCALOID. Fortunately, everything worked out and I can use it on Linux, which is my preferred environment. As always, there's a catch. Kontakt isn't accessible at all (completely incompatible with screen readers), even on Windows! This means that I'd need sighted help to use it either way. Even so, for me, it was worth it. The sound is as good as I thought it would be, and my search for a decent virtual violin is finally over! If I need more than that, the next step is learning how to play the real thing! ... But that's another story...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a final note: Embertone just released a free library for Kontakt Player, which includes, among other things, a demo of the Friedlander Violin! It will be available for a limited time (I don't know for how long), but for those who want to test this virtual violin, this is a good chance! I downloaded the library, because I want to check out the other sounds it has. And this time, the download is a direct link. Here's the &lt;a href="http://us5.campaign-archive1.com/?u=48596a6a37a057934093cef98&amp;amp;id=efa70f3075&amp;amp;e=3e9c6b1b30"&gt;link to the newsletter with the release announcement&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.embertone.com/instruments/arcane.php"&gt;the product page&lt;/a&gt;. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Audio</category><category>Violin</category><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/virtual-violins/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2014 03:17:48 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
