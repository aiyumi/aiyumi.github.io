Now it's a static blog, with only HTML pages and doesn't need PHP or a database anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why a Static Blog?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, static blogs work like this: I write posts in some markup language (I use &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;) in a text editor of my choice, then a generator program (usually command line-driven) transforms posts in HTML and combines them with layout templates of the page (header, menu, content etc.) and generates all HTML pages, which can be uploaded to any webserver. For me, writing on my favorite text editor and typing a few simple commands to generate and upload the pages is much more comfortable than struggling for hours with a heavy web interface full of JavaScript (the reason why I never got along with WordPress).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a while since I've been wanting to migrate to a static blog. I had tested several static blog generator programs, but none had exactly the features I wanted (mainly multilanguage content support). I had even started trying to program my own (in Perl), but in the end, I gave up. Then, this year (2015), I found this software called &lt;a href="https://getnikola.com/"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt; (which is written in Python). A few tests later, I concluded that it does everything I want (and then some), and decided that the time to migrate had come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;And Why the Server Change?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been hosting my sites at &lt;a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?362621"&gt;DreamHost&lt;/a&gt; since 2009 and never had any problems. Particularly, I rather like the &lt;a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/"&gt;great documentation available on their wiki&lt;/a&gt;, SSH access which enables uploading files via Rsync instead of FTP (basically, it's faster because Rsync sends only what is different between the files on my machine and the ones on the server, rather than reuploading everything all over again), the ability to install other software on the server (the wiki provides detailed instructions), the ability to edit PHP settings, among other things, and last but not least, their humorous monthly newsletters :P. Then why did I decide to change webhosts? For a few simple reasons: even though all of these features are interesting, over the years I discovered I don't need this much. I don't have as much time to develop sites as I had before, when I signed up for their service in 2009. At the time, I still didn't have a job, and believed I'd work designing sites. Then, I got a job as a Perl programmer, years passed and, in the end, the only site I've been able to maintain (more or less) actively is this one you're on right now, and it barely used PHP and MySQL. Now that the site is static, I don't even need PHP and MySQL anymore! And with the high US Dollar rates (one Dollar nearing four Brazilian Reals), the hosting plan is getting hard to afford, and it doesn't make much sense to keep paying for so many features I'm not using. That said, even if I don't use the service anymore, I still consider DreamHost's webhosting very good, and I recommend it to those who don't have problems with the Dollar rates :P , and need a webhost that supports MySQL, PHP (or Perl or Python which are also included in their plan) and SSH access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The domain registration for "warpstar.net" will still remain on DreamHost (not only because I like the included features like whoes privacy protection, but also because this serves as an excuse for me to keep receiving the humorous monthly newsletters :P ). But now, the blog is hosted on &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;, and the pages are uploaded via Git (which also only uploads the differences in the files rather than reuploading everything every time), and as a bonus, the site even got version control :D !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons above are important to me, but... okay, enough rambling. In the end, what really matters to everyone else is that all the content is here, the URLs remain the same, and the site is still online. The conversion may not have been 100%. There might be a few bugs here and there, and I intend to correct them as I find them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Site Updates</category><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/static-blog-migration/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Dec 2015 18:11:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>An Introductory Video to CeVIO</title><link>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/ath-cevio-1/</link><dc:creator>Aiyumi</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've already mentioned here on the blog a few voice synthesizer software, like &lt;a href="http://espeak.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Espeak&lt;/a&gt; (which provides a voice to my screen reader program), the Japanese voice synthesizer &lt;a href="http://open-jtalk.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Open JTalk&lt;/a&gt; (which the Windows screen reader &lt;a href="http://www.nvaccess.org/"&gt;NVDA&lt;/a&gt; uses to read Japanese text), and the singing synthesis software VOCALOID, which I've been &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/accessibility-and-how-i-began-using-vocaloid"&gt;using for a while&lt;/a&gt;.

It begins introducing a few software that came first (MMDAgent and Open JTalk), then goes on to talk about the main topic, CeVIO. It demonstrates various voice samples (both for speech and for singing), and examples of how to edit the voices' parameters to read Japanese text. (it even has tips for those wanting to buy the software :D )&lt;/p&gt;

Capcom hasn't shown any interest in continuing the series, but a few days ago, a light at the end of the tunnel came from somewhere else. Comcept, the company founded by Keiji Inafune (Rockman / Mega Man series' creator, who had left Capcom) launched a project to create a series that will become the spiritual successor to DASH/Legends. The project is called "RED ASH." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/in-the-mood-to-redash/"&gt;more…&lt;/a&gt; (12 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Games</category><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/in-the-mood-to-redash/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jul 2015 18:12:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Rockman DASH - "We are the Three Bonne Brothers" Violin Arrangements</title><link>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/bonnes-theme-arrange-2/</link><dc:creator>Aiyumi</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who have read my &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/gossec-gavotte-fvl-cover"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/virtual-violins"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; probably noticed that I'm currently obsessed with violins. It turns out that I couldn't resist and, in march of 2015, I began taking lessons to learn to play the real thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three months have passed, and I continue my &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/bonnes-theme-arrange-1"&gt;arrangements of the song "We Are the Three Bonne Brothers"&lt;/a&gt; from Rockman DASH/Mega Man Legends. Today I bring a few more versions, this time with violins, both the virtual one and the real one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These where made for my fan fiction, "&lt;a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10564022/1/Trigger-of-Change"&gt;Trigger of Change&lt;/a&gt;," where the Servbots learn to play the violin. The piano is the same as the &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/bonnes-theme-arrange-1"&gt;"Marimbonnes" version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the virtual one, made with the Embertone Friedlander Violin VST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download/listen: &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.opendrive.com/files/101759890_xIo2h_d1b5/bonnes-fvl01.ogg"&gt;bonnes-fvl01.ogg (OpenDrive)&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.4shared.com/mp3/wxHz8p3Qba/bonnes-fvl01.html"&gt;bonnes-fvl01.mp3 (4shared)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is my attempt at playing it with a real violin. Warning: beginner level playing (just three months of taking weekly lessons), and the intonation is still quite off. Also, it's my first time trying to record an acoustic instrument (recorded with a Zoom H4n portable recorder).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download/listen: &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.opendrive.com/files/101759900_0s6x3_4a1d/bonnes-realviolin01.ogg"&gt;bonnes-realviolin01.ogg (OpenDrive)&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.4shared.com/mp3/MJN7Xw8xce/bonnes-realviolin01.html"&gt;bonnes-realviolin01.mp3 (4shared)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three violins version: until I arrived at the final result above, I had to record the song over twenty times! I didn't want so many takes to go to waste, so I selected the better three of my recording (mis)takes and glued them together. The result is a trio of clumsy and out of tune Servbots.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm feeling like the protagonist of the anime/game series Kin'iro no Corda (also known as La Corda d'Oro), who is given a magical violin that anyone can play! To "celebrate," I decided to make arrangements of the music featured in the series (mostly classical music), and today I bring you my first one: the "Gavotte" by François Joseph Gossec.&lt;/p&gt;

Partly because I don't play very well :P, and also because the violin sounds of the keyboard are horrible. Wondering if the problem was only with my instrument or was common to keyboards in general, I decided to check the state of the sampled solo violin sounds available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Commercial Sample Libraries&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not a specialist by any means, but I found most of the commercial solo violin samples to be very disappointing. Even the ones from extremely expensive sound libraries (over 1000 dollars) leave much to be desired in my opinion. To me, they are so bad that it bothers me. No matter how simple the played part is, the timbre isn't smooth. It's weird, as if something was missing from the sound. And it isn't even the obvious lack of emotion (of course there's that too, but that's another story), it's something else. I don't know how to explain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the demos that I heard are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.soundsonline.com/QL-Solo-Violin"&gt;EWQL (East West Quantum Leap) Solo Violin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4K3T_mPjh8"&gt;Garritan Stradivari Solo Violin&lt;/a&gt; (discontinued). it's passable but still bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/dcuny/gpo-solo-violin-test"&gt;solo violin&lt;/a&gt; from the orchestral library &lt;a href="http://www.garritan.com/products/personal-orchestra-4/"&gt;Garritan Personal Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;. I heard that it's based on samples from the Stradivary Violin mentioned above, but it's much more limited, and you can easily notice that the quality is much worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/alucinari/update-to-bach-sonata-vsl"&gt;solo violin&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="http://www.vsl.co.at/en/211/261/2064/2067/1751.htm"&gt;Vienna Symphonic Library Special Edition&lt;/a&gt; orchestral library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/dcuny/violin-test"&gt;solo violin&lt;/a&gt; from the orchestral package &lt;a href="http://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/philharmonik/"&gt;Miroslav Philharmonik&lt;/a&gt; isn't that bad, considering that the sample library (including instruments for the whole orchestra) actually isn't very expensive (the full package costs less than 200 dollars)! And I also read that it can run on Linux through Wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Free Sample Libraries&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the free options, I found the collection of &lt;a href="http://slib.soundex.co.uk/index.php?instrument=violin"&gt;violin samples from Philharmony.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;. These have various articulations, but are in MP3 format, meaning that they suffer from quality loss, so they aren't suitable to be used for anything too serious. Another disadvantage is the license, which disallows distribution of the samples (be it for free or otherwise) the samples individually or in the form of "virtual instruments" (for example, you can't create a SF2 or SFZ file  from them and put it for download). The license allows use of the samples in commercial works, but with the quality loss caused by the MP3 compression, who's going to do that anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There're also &lt;a href="http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MISviolin.html"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MISviolin2012.html"&gt;these (recorded in 2012 and a bit better)&lt;/a&gt; samples from the University of Iowa. They are also in AIF format, include various articulations and, unlike the previous ones, they can be used without restrictions. The problems are that the notes aren't separated into individual files, and specially in the first version, several of them aren't sustained steadily or have a bit "scratchy" sound...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are the &lt;a href="http://www.freesound.org/people/ldk1609/packs/"&gt;violin samples by Ldk1609&lt;/a&gt;. To be honest, I think that these have a better timbre than the commercial libraries mentioned. They are in AIF format, so it's possible to convert them to WAV, create an SFZ file (an open sound library format) to map the audio files to MIDI notes and use, for example, in &lt;a href="http://www.linuxsampler.org/"&gt;LinuxSampler&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems that work for creating a SFZ is &lt;a href="http://www.linuxmusicians.com/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;amp;t=12530"&gt;ongoing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And (just for sake of completeness) there's &lt;a href="http://sso.mattiaswestlund.net/"&gt;Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;, available in SFZ format. Actually, it's a collection of free orchestral instrument sound samples. The solo violins are the same free ones mentioned previously, but unfortunately they are drenshed in reverb (urgh)...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Embertone Friedlander Violin&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a commercial library that I found when I wasn't looking for virtual violins. I was reading a thread while searching for something unrelated, and it mentioned this library. The thread had no link to the official page, but I decided to see if there was any demo on Youtube. I found &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KisOROAI0oc"&gt;this video demonstrating the features&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7akUpXOHZoQ"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ats-RNfU8Yc"&gt;official&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVkvo9wK-_M"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt;. I loved the sound right away. I thought, "A good instrument like this one probably costs thousands of dollars!" Google brought me the &lt;a href="http://embertone.com/instruments/friedlanderviolin.php"&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt; and I was stunned after listening to the demos... And checking the price... less than $150...! I wanted it so badly! What held me from buying it was the fact that it is an instrument for Kontakt (also compatible with the free version, Kontakt Player). The problem is that I googled about running Kontakt 5 on Linux and found nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a year later, by mid-2014, a &lt;a href="http://linux-audio.4202.n7.nabble.com/Recommended-near-realistic-strings-section-generator-td91020.html"&gt;thread appeared on the Linux-audio-user mailing list&lt;/a&gt; about recommendations of orchestral sounds on Linux, where one of the members said that he used Kontakt instruments on Linux via Wine. So I asked for more information and decided to try. Right at that time, an &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5JRW3Oyy3k&amp;amp;list=UUOP3cfW8rXbZ7vor2XUhj-w"&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; and a sale  for the Friedlander Violin came about, and I decided it was time and purchased it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, I was faced with an obstacle. Downloading the program required the use of a proprietary download manager app called Continuata Connect, where you enter the serial code gotten when purchasing the product and the software brings the files from that code (the direct links don't appear, meaning that the download can't be done via browser, Wget, Curl, ...). I tried running Continuata on Wine. It only ran in Windows XP mode. If I set Wine to "Windows 7," the program didn't even run and said that it had encountered a serious problem and couldn't start. The program ran with Wine disguised as XP, but that wasn't enough. It didn't work properly. The download always hung, the file parts got corrupted and deleted, then everything started all over again. In the end, I ended up installing the Continuata thing on my Windows partition just to download the library, and it worked with no problems on Windows (miracles happen :P). I moved the downloaded files to the Linux partition soon after, though. I don't know what causes this problem under Wine, but after a little research, I found out that other virtual instrument developers provide direct links to users who have problems with Continuata, or that can't download for whatever reason. I don't know if Embertone also does this. I didn't ask them since I had already downloaded everything, but it may be worth asking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kontakt Player installed on Wine just fine. I had some trouble setting Kontakt up, but it was related to my screen reader (software that speaks all the text on the screen, mostly used by visually impaired people to access the computer) taking over the soundcard and ALSA. People with standard setups (I.E. almost everyone else) probably won't run into this problem (but if you want more details, you can read everything that happened on &lt;a href="http://linux-audio.4202.n7.nabble.com/Embertone-Friedlander-Violin-on-Linux-was-Re-Recommended-near-realistic-strings-section-generator-td91163.html"&gt;this thread on the Linux-Audio-User mailing list&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instrument is a "Powered by Kontakt Player" library, and needs to be registered through the "Add Library" button. This button is also present in Kontakt's VST interface, but it doesn't work (it prompts you for choosing the directory where the library is installed, but gives a "No library found" error. I don't know if that also happens on Windows). You must use the standalone Kontakt to add and activate the library (you need to do it just once). After added and activated though, the instrument also appears in the VST interface and works normally. I can use it with Dssi-VST and record the output in Ecasound with no problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, I was afraid of buying the Friedlander Violin, then not being able to make it work. If that happened, my last resort would be to use it on Windows, like I'm doing with VOCALOID. Fortunately, everything worked out and I can use it on Linux, which is my preferred environment. As always, there's a catch. Kontakt isn't accessible at all (completely incompatible with screen readers), even on Windows! This means that I'd need sighted help to use it either way. Even so, for me, it was worth it. The sound is as good as I thought it would be, and my search for a decent virtual violin is finally over! If I need more than that, the next step is learning how to play the real thing! ... But that's another story...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a final note: Embertone just released a free library for Kontakt Player, which includes, among other things, a demo of the Friedlander Violin! It will be available for a limited time (I don't know for how long), but for those who want to test this virtual violin, this is a good chance! I downloaded the library, because I want to check out the other sounds it has. And this time, the download is a direct link. Here's the &lt;a href="http://us5.campaign-archive1.com/?u=48596a6a37a057934093cef98&amp;amp;id=efa70f3075&amp;amp;e=3e9c6b1b30"&gt;link to the newsletter with the release announcement&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.embertone.com/instruments/arcane.php"&gt;the product page&lt;/a&gt;. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Audio</category><category>Violin</category><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/virtual-violins/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2014 03:17:48 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>In the Mood to DASH!</title><link>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/in-the-mood-to-dash/</link><dc:creator>Aiyumi</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I began revisiting the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_Legends"&gt;Rockman DASH (Mega Man Legends)&lt;/a&gt; series, watching (read "listening") some playthroughs and cutscenes to refresh my memory (I don't have the games anymore), trying to finally understand the plot. I didn't know enough of either Japanese or English to be able to grasp it at the time I played, which was some 12 years ago. Turns out that I can't fully figure it out even now :P. I have the impression that the second game (the one with the major plot points) felt a bit rushed, some important things are mentioned only in passing and aren't expanded anywhere. After the cancellation of DASH/Legends 3, it's unlikely that we'll be seeing these answers anytime soon. I also noticed differences between the dialogue from the English version and the original Japanese (inconsistencies in the translation/usage of names and terms) which may affect how we view a characters personality, as well as parts of the plot itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, I still think it's a good plot, albeit a bit confusing and full of unexplored potential. That calls to one thing: fan fiction!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After checking the playthroughs, then reading a few discussions and fan fictions to see how other people interpret the plot, I was inspired to write my own fanfic, intitled "&lt;a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10564022/1/Trigger-of-Change"&gt;Trigger of Change&lt;/a&gt;". And like I did with my &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/pokemon/sl/drama"&gt;Pokemon fic&lt;/a&gt;, I began making Japanese anime style audio dramas out of it. This prompted the creation of a new &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/rockman"&gt;Rockman section&lt;/a&gt; on the site, with the page for the audio dramas &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/rockman/toc/drama"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude this post, I leave you with my VOCALOID cover of "Anata no Kaze ga Fuku Kara", the ending song to the first game. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

Here I'd like to share my progress, as well as a few tips for any visually impaired user that eventually decides to use VOCALOID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/accessibility-first-results-with-vocaloid/"&gt;more…&lt;/a&gt; (4 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Audio</category><category>VOCALOID</category><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/accessibility-first-results-with-vocaloid/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jun 2014 01:47:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Accessibility, and How I Began Using VOCALOID</title><link>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/accessibility-and-how-i-began-using-vocaloid/</link><dc:creator>Aiyumi</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What is VOCALOID?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's something that became quite popular in the last few years, but I had no idea of what it was until 2011. I just knew it had to do with music, and for a while I had thought it was the name of a band (hahahaha)! But no. VOCALOID is a singing synthesis software, paid and proprietary, whose engine is developed by Yamaha. The voices are provided by real people, mostly actors or singers. Each voice is represented by a character. The most popular one is Hatsune Miku (I don't like her very much) but there are many others. VOCALOID runs on Windows and Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For detailed information on all VOCALOID voicebanks available, visit the &lt;a href="http://vocaloid.wikia.com/"&gt;VOCALOID Wiki&lt;/a&gt; (which explains all this much better than me :P).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of songs with VOCALOID:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5kUd72R_tg"&gt;"Packaged", with the Hatsune Miku voicebank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0PmG_zQjy4"&gt;Natsu no Umi ("夏の海"), with the Kagamine Len and Kagamine Rin voicebanks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56Gk1Z1US0"&gt;"Cendrillon", with the VY2 and VY1 voicebanks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mL0n9zt7IdI"&gt;"Aitai" ("会いたい"), with the Megpoid/Gumi voicebank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w03Ld2T5MaU"&gt;"Greensleeves", with the Avanna voicebank (English)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdyO_vGX8KU"&gt;Cover of "Roda Viva", with the Galaco voicebank (forced to sing in Portuguese!)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;UTAU&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UTAU (meaning "to sing" in Japanese), is the name of another singing synthesis program, however it was developed by a fan. It's also proprietary, but is free (technically it's a shareware, but one of the few "advantages" of paying are just some interface improvements and maybe access to earlier test versions before the "general public", but it works for free with no problems). The voices are also provided by real people, with the difference that anyone can record his/her own voice and put it in the program without relying on contracts, studios and professional singers. So it has much more available voicebanks than VOCALOID, but the downside is that the quality varies greatly depending on the recording quality, the voicebank settings, the intonation and the pronunciation of the person who made the recording. UTAU has a version for Windows, and also one for Mac called UTAU Synth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of songs with UTAU:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPOfe-TA3YI"&gt;"Kenka Wakare" ("けんか別れ"), with the Momone Momo voicebank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP1uQNueWXA"&gt;"Error," with the Namine Ritsu Kire voicebank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFuuxl3u3E"&gt;Cover of "Yuudachi no Ribon" ("夕立のりぼん"), with the Sukone Tei voicebank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about UTAU, check out the &lt;a href="http://utau.wikia.com/"&gt;UTAU Wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon I began wanting to use the programs to make my own covers, and that was when the problems started. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/accessibility-and-how-i-began-using-vocaloid/"&gt;more…&lt;/a&gt; (7 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Audio</category><category>VOCALOID</category><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/accessibility-and-how-i-began-using-vocaloid/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2014 13:12:25 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
