It's not the latest Orca version, but rather, it's the one compatible with the library versions that come in Slackware by default (to install the latest Orca, we'd need to recompile newer versions of many of the Slackware-provided programs, which would be much more difficult).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Slackware 14.1 to 14.2, the number of dependencies reduced a lot, which is a good thing. Most of the Gnome-specific libraries are gone, there's no longer the need to recompile programs that came with Slackware, and now everything that uses Python depends on Python 3 instead of Python 2. If more of these changes keep coming and making things easier, soon it might be possible for Orca to enter Slackbuilds.org, then we will no longer have to do all this juggling with &lt;a href="https://github.com/aiyumi/slackware-scripts"&gt;my scripts&lt;/a&gt;. Let's hope!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who used &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/installing-orca-on-slackware-14-0"&gt;my instructions and installed Orca on 14.0 or 14.1&lt;/a&gt; and is upgrading to 14.2, you need to remove obsolete dependencies with the command below (those who still don't have Orca installed don't need to use this command, but just look how many dependencies are gone :D ):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;# removepkg gnome-mime-data gnome-vfs gnome-python libgnome libbonobo ORBit2 pyorbit
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, the instructions themselves. First of all, you need &lt;a href="http://sbopkg.org/"&gt;Sbopkg&lt;/a&gt; to be installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, the process to download and install Orca remains mostly the same as it was &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/installing-orca-on-slackware-14-0"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;. You can read the previous instructions for more in depth explanations if you want, but basically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download my repository and configure Sbopkg to use my scripts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;# git clone https://github.com/aiyumi/slackware-scripts.git
# cd slackware-scripts
# cp -R slackbuilds /var/lib/sbopkg/aiyumisb
# cp slackbuilds/100-aiyumi.repo /etc/sbopkg/repos.d
# cp sbopkg-queuefiles/aiyumisb/accessibility/*.sqf /var/lib/sbopkg/queues
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run Sbopkg and use my repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;# sbopkg -V aiyumisb/local
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you still don't have Espeak (which Orca uses by default), go to "Queue" -&amp;gt; "Load," load the "espeakup" queuefile and install everything. Espeak will be installed along with Espeakup, which adds support for speech via software to Speakupp (a screen reader for the console, which is always good to have).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to "Queue" -&amp;gt; "Load," load the "orca" queuefile, install everything, and wait for the process to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit the Speech-Dispatcher settings in "/etc/speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf." Make sure the Espeak module is set to load and to use your preferred language as default (in my case, Portuguese). The relevant lines are below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;# ----- VOICE PARAMETERS -----
DefaultLanguage "en"

# -----OUTPUT MODULES CONFIGURATION-----
AddModule "espeak"       "sd_espeak"   "espeak.conf"

DefaultModule espeak

LanguageDefaultModule "en"  "espeak"
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To test it, use the command "spd-say something." If you hear sound, then it's working!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, copy the file "/usr/doc/orca-*/orca.atspi2.xinitrc" to "~/.xinitrc" (it's the file that sets the accessibility-related variables for the graphical interface), and change the last line to start your favorite window manager or desktop (for example, "startfluxbox" for Fluxbox, or "startxfce4" for XFCE).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Done! Now you can just use the "startx" command to enter the graphical interface and hear Orca "run it's mouth" :D .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A note about Firefox: In the instructions for 14.0 and 14.1, I had said that Slackware's Firefox came with disabled accessibility and needed to be recompiled, which took hours. The bad news is that Slackware's Firefox still comes with no accessibility. But the good news is that I found out that we don't need to recompile it! Thanks to this &lt;a href="http://whatthefrankiej.blogspot.com/2014/12/gnome-orca-on-slackware-141.html"&gt;post by Frankiej&lt;/a&gt;, I learned that there's &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/ruario/9672798"&gt;this script&lt;/a&gt; that downloads the Firefox binary provided by Mozilla (where accessibility works) and creates a ".txz" Slackware package that can be installed with installpkg as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the name "latest-firefox," this script isn't limited to downloading only the latest version of Firefox. You can actually use it to download any version you want. Just pass the "VERSION" variable to the command that executes the script. For example, at the time of this writing, the Java plugin doesn't work in the latest version of Firefox because they removed support for the API that the Java plugin uses. For those who need the Java plugin, while a compatible version of the plugin doesn't come out, the workaround is to use an earlier version of Firefox where the Java plugin still works. The latest version of Firefox where the obsolete API works is 51.0. In this case, the command to get the Firefox 51.0 package for Slack would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;# VERSION=51.0 ./latest-firefox.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Or, for Firefox 51.0 with the interface in Brazilian Portuguese:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;# VERSION=51.0 FFLANG=pt-BR ./latest-firefox.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And the program will leave the package in "/tmp." Enough of having to wait three hours to compile Firefox at each version :P .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>linux</category><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/installing-orca-on-slackware-14.2/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2017 18:58:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Slackware 14.2, Screen Readers and PulseAudio</title><link>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/slack-14.2-srs-and-pulse/</link><dc:creator>Aiyumi</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a very long while, I'm finally on Slackware 14.2. It's been almost one year since 14.2 came out, but I wasn't brave enough to upgrade, mainly because when I had tried to upgrade the installation on my netbook (which served as my test subject as usual), it hadn't worked (it's the first time I have problems trying to update Slackware). The system became mute in the middle of the upgrade and I lost access to my screen reader programs that I depend on to do anything on the computer (good thing it was on the netbook and not on my main machine!). I was unable to fix the problem, lost the patience to investigate, and ended up leaving it aside for a long time. Now that I'm on vacation from work and have a little more time, I finally gathered the patience and the courage to try again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/slack-14.2-srs-and-pulse/"&gt;moreâ€¦&lt;/a&gt; (5 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>linux</category><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/slack-14.2-srs-and-pulse/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2017 18:55:46 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Bach/Gounod Ave Maria on Violin (F Major)</title><link>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/bg-ave-maria-violin-1/</link><dc:creator>Aiyumi</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "Ave Maria" by Charles Gounod, based on Bach's "Prelude in C Major." This is one of the songs I've been wanting to play since even before I started learning the violin. To my pleasant surprise, it is in Shinozaki Violin Method book 2, although it's in F major instead of C major like the original (the C version is on a more advanced level, and is on book 3 if I'm not mistaken).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I recorded the violin, I still didn't have the accompaniment ready, so I had to use a metronome click track to try to record at the right tempo. Sadly, I recorded the violin countless times and the result wasn't as good as I'd have liked, but it's the best I could do at the current level. When I arrive at the C major version in the next book, hopefully I can finally make it the way I've always wanted...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accompaniment MIDI file was created on Linux using a command line program called &lt;a href="http://www.mellowood.ca/mma/"&gt;MMA (Musical Midi Accompaniment)&lt;/a&gt;. It was typed in C major and transposed to F major (yes, I admit, I cheated:P . At least I'll already have the accompaniment ready when I get to the C major version). Then the audio was rendered with the harp sound from my Motif XF keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: I only realized this much later... it looks like I mixed up the audio files and ended up not using the audio generated by the Motif XF. This harp sound is actually from the Fluid R3 Soundfont... whoops.&lt;/p&gt;

A Few Impressions and Quick Tips</title><link>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/ps4-slim-review/</link><dc:creator>Aiyumi</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main reason why I had never been interested in the PS3, and why it took me so long to get interested in the PS4 was because they had no games that appealed to me. The PS3 and the PS4's main strengths seem to be games for hardcore gamers, action-packed games with stunning graphics. Mainly shooting, war, and football games, which aren't my cup of tea (I prefer quieter games like turn-based RPGs). However, some JRPGs (Japanese RPGs) of my interest are coming to the PS4, especially Persona 5, RED ASH, and Final Fantasy VII Remake. So, I finally decided that I'd buy a PS4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After many months of waiting and comparing prices, and then learning that the PS4 Slim would be released, thus having to wait even longer, I finally got my PS4! (as the saying goes, good things come to those who wait :P ) Actually, I was going to wait a bit more, but the US elections results made the US Dollar rates against the Brazilian Real rise like crazy, and because games are mostly imported here in Brazil, prices only tend to go up. So, I decided it was now or... well, I wouldn't say, "never," but who knows when prices would return to acceptable values â€‹â€‹if I were to wait more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opted for the PS4 Slim because, according to my researches, it is quieter and consumes less power, and the battery of the (wireless) controller's new revision that comes with it also lasts longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some tips and observations that I gathered during my researches and tests, as well as my impressions on the console. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/ps4-slim-review/"&gt;moreâ€¦&lt;/a&gt; (8 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Games</category><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/ps4-slim-review/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2016 23:55:22 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Watch the Persona 5 Special Anime Episode Online</title><link>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/watch-p5-db-online/</link><dc:creator>Aiyumi</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/getting-ready-for-persona5"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I talked about the Persona series, and how I'm excited about Persona 5's release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 3rd, 2016, a special Persona 5 anime episode aired in Japan to promote the game. It is titled, "Persona 5 the Animation - the Day Breakers," and is about the main gang doing a random sidequest (it's an optional mission that doesn't interfere with the main plot of the game. So, no worries about spoilers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/"&gt;Crunchyroll&lt;/a&gt; is a site that licenses and legally streams anime with English subtitles. It shares the money earned from its subscribers with the anime creators, and has also a selection of anime available to watch for free (although with ads interrupting the video from time to time :P ). The site made the Persona 5 special episode available for its subscribers on September 3rd, simultaneously as the anime's airing in Japan. One week later (on September 10th), the episode also became available for non-subscribers, and can be watched for free &lt;a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/persona5-the-animation-the-day-breakers-/episode-0-persona-5-the-animation-the-day-breakers-719079"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (no account or anything needed.

An extremely brief introduction for those who don't know about these games: the Persona games are JRPGs (japanese RPGs) about high school students that need to balance studies, outings with friends, and fights against supernatural phenomena where they summon a kind of "inner self" in the form of creatures called "Persona." Both the Personas and the enemies are based on mythological beings, angels, demons and such. The games contain charismatic and well-developed characters, engaging storylines, and humorous scenes typical of anime. From Persona 3 onwards, the games have a calendar system where we follow the protagonists during the course of one year, where we can observe several aspects of Japanese culture such as typical foods (these games even made me &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/p3-food-ramen"&gt;try my hand at preparing ramen&lt;/a&gt;! :P ), some locations, and even what days are holidays on Japan's calendar! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/getting-ready-for-persona5/"&gt;moreâ€¦&lt;/a&gt; (6 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Games</category><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/getting-ready-for-persona5/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2016 17:25:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>[Violin] "Young Wing" - Duets with the Teachers</title><link>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/wakai-tsubasa-violin-1/</link><dc:creator>Aiyumi</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got to the last song on the Shinozaki Violin Method Vol.1. It's called "Wakai Tsubasa" (lit. "Young Wing"), by a Japanese composer named Taijiro Go (1907-1971). It's a duet (for two violins) and, basically, it's quite cheerful, fast-paced,  and has sequences of successive repeated notes that quickly get confusing and is easy to mess up :P .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned the first violin part and performed a duet with my teacher Fabiane Suzuki (before anyone asks, no, despite her surname and the fact that she's a violinist, she has nothing to do with the Suzuki from the violin method :P ). Here goes the recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download/listen: &lt;a href="https://od.lk/d/113109650_RSNCb/wakai-tsubasa-duet-f01.ogg"&gt;wakai-tsubasa-duet-f01.ogg (OpenDrive)&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.4shared.com/mp3/QaBauN7vce/wakai-tsubasa-duet-f01.html"&gt;wakai-tsubasa-duet-f01.mp3 (4shared)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after that, I also had the opportunity to perform along with Juan Rossi, also a violinist and a teacher - he even studied in Austria and performs at OSESP (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orquestra_Sinf%C3%B4nica_do_Estado_de_S%C3%A3o_Paulo"&gt;SÃ£o Paulo State Symphony&lt;/a&gt;), a great reference). It was an honor to perform with him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download/listen: &lt;a href="https://od.lk/d/113109642_TK457/wakai-tsubasa-duet-j01.ogg"&gt;wakai-tsubasa-duet-j01.ogg (OpenDrive)&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.4shared.com/mp3/BBy3qv50ba/wakai-tsubasa-duet-j01.html"&gt;wakai-tsubasa-duet-j01.mp3 (4shared)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a lot of pressure. Performing along with the superb teachers, while knowing it was being recorded! (well, I had been the one to suggest recording, actually...) While I performed, I did my best not to think about anything else, and focused completely on my violin part so that I wouldn't get lost in the mess of notes. The music is fast, and I hurried to follow the accompaniment (rather than it accompanying me :P ) to not get left behind. At least I didn't get paralyzed and managed to be in sync with the second violin until the end. Despite going out of tune some times and a few little mistakes, the results came out rather nice (pressure and stuff considered), and I felt very accomplished. Doing the duets was quite the experience! Now, on to learning the second violin part...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Audio</category><category>Violin</category><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/wakai-tsubasa-violin-1/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2016 21:35:10 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Food from Persona 3: Ramen</title><link>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/p3-food-ramen/</link><dc:creator>Aiyumi</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year (2015), I played an RPG for Playstation 2 called Persona 3 FES. The plot is set in Japan and the game shows various aspects of Japanese culture. Among often featured events are scenes where the characters go out to eat ramen (a noodle-based dish that is very popular  in Japan) and takoyaki (roasted octopus dumpling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well... I have to admit that, despite being of Japanese descent, I had never eaten either ramen or takoyaki. The noodles-based dish I've known from my childhood is just udon (simple noodles) cooked in water with shoyu (soy sauce). The only thing with "ramen" in the name I had ever eaten was the instant noodles from Nissin Foods labeled as "instant ramen", but I guess this doesn't really count :P . I've always heard a lot about both ramen and takoyaki, but had never stopped to think about them. Only after playing Persona 3 I actually realized I had never eaten either of them! ... Yes, weird, but it's true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, my mother and I came across a ramen-ya (or ramen shop, a restaurant specializing in ramen) and decided to enter. We ordered the cheapest option, just to get a sense of what ramen tasted like. We got a large bowl of broth with noodles and seaweed flakes inside, and three very thin pork slices and a half boiled egg on top. Was it good? Yes, it was, but... not as much as I thought it should be. The taste didn't go much beyond the good ol' udon in shoyu, and left that impression that something wasn't quite right... I don't know if the people running the place are Japanese (the staff at least wasn't) and I don't know how close it gets to a ramen shop from Japan, but their food left much to be desired in my opinion. Even though we had ordered the simplest option, and even though I don't know how true ramen should taste like, I believe the acclaimed ramen is supposed to be something unique, on a different level, and not possible to simply be compared to udon hastily cooked in shoyu. After this frustration, I decided to leave the curiosity about ramen aside for the moment. Maybe another day, at a better restaurant ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forward to end of March 2016. I was writing a fan fiction about the aforementioned Persona 3. It was a scene featuring a Japanese food, and I decided to research about it to reduce the chances of writing wrong information. This research took me to a &lt;a href="http://www.japanesecooking101.com/"&gt;site with Japanese food recipes&lt;/a&gt; and, by chance, I stumbled upon their &lt;a href="http://www.japanesecooking101.com/ramen-recipe/"&gt;ramen recipe&lt;/a&gt;. Then, something unexpected happened. I don't know what got into me, and I had the crazy idea of trying to make ramen...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a problem right away. The recipe was in English, and, to my surprise, I found that cooking vocabulary was quite different from the "normal" vocabulary I was used to. Literal translations of verbs and ingredient names often make no sense in Portuguese (my native language), and I had to consult sites with Portuguese to English translations of cooking terms. Once I was able to decypher the terms, I could understand the recipe reasonably. It actually didn't seem that complicated, and yet I had the impression that it had the potential to turn out better than the ramen from that restaurant!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not much into cooking (my lack of will to cook, as well as my lack of ability in the kitchen partly because of my vision impairment, are some of my greatest worries), but since that crazy idea managed to get me motivated, I figured I'd try to take advantage of the situation. Who knows? Maybe if I get incentives to practice, I might end up learning to like cooking, or at least come to not dislike it so much...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can cut the ingredients (like vegetables) reasonably well, although it takes more time than it normally should. The biggest problem is to tame the beast called stove. Without the ability to see, I still don't know how to tell when things have cooked enough, for example. For now, my mother is helping me with the stove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, everything went fine as we followed the recipe, and our ramen got ready! Below is a picture of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-center" src="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/uploads/images/p3-food-ramen/my-ramen.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="A bowl of soup with noodles in the bottom, and a thick slice of pork, a half boiled egg and very thin pieces of green onions on top. Since our bowl is small and can't fit much inside, the noodles got hidden beneath the other things and hardly appears in the photo."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference from the recipe was that I didn't use the "angel hair pasta in baking soda" workaround that was meant to substitute for the Japanese noodles (I used fresh ramen noodles from our local Japanese grocery store ). Also, I didn't put moyashi (bean sprouts) on the topping because I don't like it much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, fortunately the ramen was to our liking. It was a bit of work but I think it was worth it. And yes, it turned out better than the one from the restaurant! I still don't know how real ramen is supposed to taste like, but according to visitors' comments on the recipe's page, some said the results reminded them of the ramen they had had in Japan. So, I'll consider this as a reasonable approximation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright. The ramen's done.

&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/flying-on-brahms-waltz"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I had mentioned the Brahms' lullaby. And it so happens that I've recently learned to play it on the violin. So, here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

The book only says that it's a waltz composed by Johannes Brahms, but in fact, its whole title is "Waltz Opus 39 Number 15". My homework was to describe what comes to mind when listening to this music. And I was supposed to let my imagination fly (nothing like, "The composer meant this, this and that"). So I let it fly. It flew through the roof, and towards the clouds (more on this below). I've always liked to imagine the songs I listen to as though they were the "background music" or the "soundtrack" for something, so it was an interesting experience. Here's the result (warning: ramblings of someone who has no classical music background whatsoever :P): &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/flying-on-brahms-waltz/"&gt;moreâ€¦&lt;/a&gt; (3 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Audio</category><category>Violin</category><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/flying-on-brahms-waltz/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 21 Dec 2015 23:29:17 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
