This is one of the songs I've been wanting to play since even before I started learning the violin. To my pleasant surprise, it is in Shinozaki Violin Method book 2, although it's in F major instead of C major like the original (the C version is on a more advanced level, and is on book 3 if I'm not mistaken).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I recorded the violin, I still didn't have the accompaniment ready, so I had to use a metronome click track to try to record at the right tempo. Sadly, I recorded the violin countless times and the result wasn't as good as I'd have liked, but it's the best I could do at the current level. When I arrive at the C major version in the next book, hopefully I can finally make it the way I've always wanted...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accompaniment MIDI file was created on Linux using a command line program called &lt;a href="http://www.mellowood.ca/mma/"&gt;MMA (Musical Midi Accompaniment)&lt;/a&gt;. It was typed in C major and transposed to F major (yes, I admit, I cheated:P . At least I'll already have the accompaniment ready when I get to the C major version). Then the audio was rendered with the harp sound from my Motif XF keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: I only realized this much later... it looks like I mixed up the audio files and ended up not using the audio generated by the Motif XF. This harp sound is actually from the Fluid R3 Soundfont... whoops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download/listen to the audio: &lt;a href="https://od.lk/d/117938117_sWISc/bg-ave-maria_f01.ogg"&gt;bg-ave-maria_f01.ogg (OpenDrive)&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.4shared.com/mp3/JbcR6_qhba/bg-ave-maria_f01.html"&gt;bg-ave-maria_f01.mp3 (4shared)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It's called "Wakai Tsubasa" (lit. "Young Wing"), by a Japanese composer named Taijiro Go (1907-1971). It's a duet (for two violins) and, basically, it's quite cheerful, fast-paced,  and has sequences of successive repeated notes that quickly get confusing and is easy to mess up :P .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned the first violin part and performed a duet with my teacher Fabiane Suzuki (before anyone asks, no, despite her surname and the fact that she's a violinist, she has nothing to do with the Suzuki from the violin method :P ). Here goes the recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download/listen: &lt;a href="https://od.lk/d/113109650_RSNCb/wakai-tsubasa-duet-f01.ogg"&gt;wakai-tsubasa-duet-f01.ogg (OpenDrive)&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.4shared.com/mp3/QaBauN7vce/wakai-tsubasa-duet-f01.html"&gt;wakai-tsubasa-duet-f01.mp3 (4shared)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after that, I also had the opportunity to perform along with Juan Rossi, also a violinist and a teacher - he even studied in Austria and performs at OSESP (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orquestra_Sinf%C3%B4nica_do_Estado_de_S%C3%A3o_Paulo"&gt;SÃ£o Paulo State Symphony&lt;/a&gt;), a great reference). It was an honor to perform with him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download/listen: &lt;a href="https://od.lk/d/113109642_TK457/wakai-tsubasa-duet-j01.ogg"&gt;wakai-tsubasa-duet-j01.ogg (OpenDrive)&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.4shared.com/mp3/BBy3qv50ba/wakai-tsubasa-duet-j01.html"&gt;wakai-tsubasa-duet-j01.mp3 (4shared)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a lot of pressure. Performing along with the superb teachers, while knowing it was being recorded! (well, I had been the one to suggest recording, actually...) While I performed, I did my best not to think about anything else, and focused completely on my violin part so that I wouldn't get lost in the mess of notes. The music is fast, and I hurried to follow the accompaniment (rather than it accompanying me :P ) to not get left behind. At least I didn't get paralyzed and managed to be in sync with the second violin until the end. Despite going out of tune some times and a few little mistakes, the results came out rather nice (pressure and stuff considered), and I felt very accomplished. Doing the duets was quite the experience! Now, on to learning the second violin part...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Audio</category><category>Violin</category><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/wakai-tsubasa-violin-1/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2016 21:35:10 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Brahms Lullaby on Violin</title><link>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/brahms-lullaby-violin-1/</link><dc:creator>Aiyumi</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 8th, 2016, marked one year since I began taking violin lessons, and I decided to write this post to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/flying-on-brahms-waltz"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I had mentioned the Brahms' lullaby. And it so happens that I've recently learned to play it on the violin. So, here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

It turns out that I couldn't resist and, in march of 2015, I began taking lessons to learn to play the real thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three months have passed, and I continue my &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/bonnes-theme-arrange-1"&gt;arrangements of the song "We Are the Three Bonne Brothers"&lt;/a&gt; from Rockman DASH/Mega Man Legends. Today I bring a few more versions, this time with violins, both the virtual one and the real one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These where made for my fan fiction, "&lt;a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10564022/1/Trigger-of-Change"&gt;Trigger of Change&lt;/a&gt;," where the Servbots learn to play the violin. The piano is the same as the &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/bonnes-theme-arrange-1"&gt;"Marimbonnes" version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the virtual one, made with the Embertone Friedlander Violin VST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download/listen: &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.opendrive.com/files/101759890_xIo2h_d1b5/bonnes-fvl01.ogg"&gt;bonnes-fvl01.ogg (OpenDrive)&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.4shared.com/mp3/wxHz8p3Qba/bonnes-fvl01.html"&gt;bonnes-fvl01.mp3 (4shared)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is my attempt at playing it with a real violin. Warning: beginner level playing (just three months of taking weekly lessons), and the intonation is still quite off. Also, it's my first time trying to record an acoustic instrument (recorded with a Zoom H4n portable recorder).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download/listen: &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.opendrive.com/files/101759900_0s6x3_4a1d/bonnes-realviolin01.ogg"&gt;bonnes-realviolin01.ogg (OpenDrive)&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.4shared.com/mp3/MJN7Xw8xce/bonnes-realviolin01.html"&gt;bonnes-realviolin01.mp3 (4shared)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three violins version: until I arrived at the final result above, I had to record the song over twenty times! I didn't want so many takes to go to waste, so I selected the better three of my recording (mis)takes and glued them together. The result is a trio of clumsy and out of tune Servbots.&lt;/p&gt;

I didn't know enough of either Japanese or English to be able to grasp it at the time I played, which was some 12 years ago. Turns out that I can't fully figure it out even now :P. I have the impression that the second game (the one with the major plot points) felt a bit rushed, some important things are mentioned only in passing and aren't expanded anywhere. After the cancellation of DASH/Legends 3, it's unlikely that we'll be seeing these answers anytime soon. I also noticed differences between the dialogue from the English version and the original Japanese (inconsistencies in the translation/usage of names and terms) which may affect how we view a characters personality, as well as parts of the plot itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, I still think it's a good plot, albeit a bit confusing and full of unexplored potential. That calls to one thing: fan fiction!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After checking the playthroughs, then reading a few discussions and fan fictions to see how other people interpret the plot, I was inspired to write my own fanfic, intitled "&lt;a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10564022/1/Trigger-of-Change"&gt;Trigger of Change&lt;/a&gt;". And like I did with my &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/pokemon/sl/drama"&gt;Pokemon fic&lt;/a&gt;, I began making Japanese anime style audio dramas out of it. This prompted the creation of a new &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/rockman"&gt;Rockman section&lt;/a&gt; on the site, with the page for the audio dramas &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/rockman/toc/drama"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude this post, I leave you with my VOCALOID cover of "Anata no Kaze ga Fuku Kara", the ending song to the first game. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did an arrangement of another music from Pokemon Black &amp;amp; White. It's the music titled "Ghetsis' Ambitions". Listen &amp;amp; download &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eUh9bHd7aM"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://gobblin.se/u/aiyumi/m/pokemon-bw-arrange-of-ghetsis-ambitions-motif-xf/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably this is where I'm most active at the moment. I never mentioned it here before, but for some time now, I've been writing a Pokemon Black &amp;amp; White fan fiction (in English). It's called &lt;a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8853146/1/"&gt;Soul Link&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm silently updating it regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did an audio drama adaptation of a scene from said fan fiction. The fanfic is in English, but the audio drama is in Japanese. The dialogue is mostly the same as the one from the fan fiction, so for those who understood the scene in the fic, the Japanese drama can probably be understood as well. A few people who like watching anime with Japanese audio might like it... Or not :P. Anyway, it can be found &lt;a href="https://gobblin.se/u/aiyumi/m/psl-ch004-true-plans/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It also uses the music arrangement I just mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I uploaded a few more sounds to &lt;a href="http://www.freesound.org/people/Aiyumi/"&gt;Freesound&lt;/a&gt;. I also added a lot of interesting sounds from other people to my &lt;a href="http://www.freesound.org/people/Aiyumi/bookmarks/"&gt;bookmarks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally got around to organizing my SlackBuilds for compiling Orca under Slackware and &lt;a href="https://github.com/aiyumi/slackware-scripts"&gt;uploaded them to Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit (2013-09-27): instructions on how to use the scripts now can be found &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/installing-orca-on-slackware-14-0"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a 3DS XL. I wasn't thinking on doing that yet, but once again, I found a cheap one (for Brazil standards), and since prices in general are rising due to inflation, I decided to do it before it got too expensive. I won't make a full review like I did with the other one, but it suffices to say that compared to the normal 3DS, the buttons are more comfortable, the console is easier to hold (though a bit heavier) and the battery lasts more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mid July, my internet connection stayed down for nearly two weeks, affecting my work and everything. Calling the ISP only resulted in pointless excuses most of the time, and it took very long for them to have the will to send a technician here and fix it. It was a problem affecting the whole region where I live. Hopefully it's sorted out now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I've been listening a lot of Japanese music which uses singing synthesis software like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocaloid"&gt;VOCALOID&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utau"&gt;UTAU&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, a lot happened, as you can see. The problem is that I don't have the patience to write a full blog post for each thing I do, let alone in three languages... And I realized: isn't that the purpose of a microblog like Twitter? Right now, my Twitter isn't seeing much use aside from automatically alerting when I post something here. I'm thinking of making it update (preferably automatically) whenever I publish a fanfic chapter, or a Youtube video and maybe a few other things, so people can know I'm still active even if this blog isn't updated so often. The account is "&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aiyumi_en"&gt;@aiyumi_en&lt;/a&gt;". You can follow me, or if you're like me and aren't much into these social network things, you can use this &lt;a href="http://www.rssitfor.me/getrss?name=aiyumi_en"&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Audio</category><category>Fan-Made</category><category>Games</category><category>Site Updates</category><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/twitter-and-updates/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 22 Sep 2013 18:39:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Sounds of Ilha Grande</title><link>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/sounds-of-ilha-grande/</link><dc:creator>Aiyumi</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;In November 2011, I went on a trip to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilha_Grande"&gt;Ilha Grande, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil&lt;/a&gt;. I took my 
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QWBM62/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B001QWBM62&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=aiyumysites01-20"&gt;Zoom H4n Handy Portable Digital Recorder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=aiyumysites01-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B001QWBM62" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"&gt;
 and recorded sounds of nature, sea, birds and other things. I wanted to edit them in &lt;a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Audacity&lt;/a&gt; to cut out the unwanted parts (as far as I know, with command line audio editors such as &lt;a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/"&gt;SoX&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://eca.cx/ecasound/"&gt;Ecasound&lt;/a&gt; there isn't a practical way to remove several small portions from the middle of the file. The only way of doing this that I know involves calculating sound durations, positions etc., so it really had to be Audacity), but on my old computer, the said program crashed very frequently (strangely, this only happened to it) and I was unable to get anything done. I got a new computer, and now Audacity works perfectly. I Finally managed to tidy the files up, and now I proudly present you... The &lt;a href="http://www.freesound.org/people/Aiyumi/packs/11833/"&gt;Sounds of Ilha Grande&lt;/a&gt;! They're hosted at &lt;a href="http://www.freesound.org/"&gt;Freesound.org&lt;/a&gt;, which is a site that has thousands of free sound effects, most of them under a Creative Commons License, and others in the public domain. I have more miscellaneous sounds here in my HD, which I plan to upload there over time, but I'll write here on the blog only if there's something interesting enough to deserve a post, so if you want, follow my &lt;a href="http://www.freesound.org/people/Aiyumi/"&gt;Freesound page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Audio</category><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/sounds-of-ilha-grande/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2013 03:29:11 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Pokemon BW - Team Plasma's Theme Arrangement</title><link>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/plasma-theme-arrange-1/</link><dc:creator>Aiyumi</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I did an arrangement of Team Plasma's theme music, from the games Pokemon Black &amp;amp; White.
