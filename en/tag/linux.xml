&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/"&gt;SoX&lt;/a&gt; (Sound eXchange) is, as the author calls it, "the Swiss Army 
knife of sound processing programs". It is free, open source and runs under Windows, Mac and Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SoX can play, record, convert, edit, split, join and apply various effects to 
audio files of many different formats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/sox-basic-intro/"&gt;moreâ€¦&lt;/a&gt; (5 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Audio</category><category>linux</category><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/sox-basic-intro/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 09 Sep 2011 16:19:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>A Small Status Update</title><link>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/status-update-2011-08-04/</link><dc:creator>Aiyumi</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After upgrading Speech-Dispatcher, the Orca screen reader couldn't detect the Japanese voice synthesizer anymore. I thought it was because Orca's version was old, so I upgraded it along with AT-SPI, then Orca stopped working. Until this problem was solved, I stayed on the command line (console). I could do some interesting things in text mode, but unfortunately I couldn't use any screen reader with Japanese. Now, I've just managed to get Orca plus Japanese back, so I am writing this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the problem that stopped Orca from working... It is said that AT-SPI1 and 2 can coexist peacefully in the same system, but here, their files got mixed for some reason and caused a conflict. I don't use AT-SPI1 for a long time, so I removed it. After compiling and installing the new AT-SPI2, some additional dependencies and Orca, everything seems to be back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it for today. In other articles, I might talk about some of the interesting things that can be done on the console. For now, I'm glad I can use Japanese on the PC again!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>linux</category><category>Site Updates</category><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/status-update-2011-08-04/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2011 16:18:09 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
