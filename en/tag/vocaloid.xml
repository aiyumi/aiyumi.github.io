There's another Japanese voice synthesiser program (both for speech and for singing) called &lt;a href="http://cevio.jp/"&gt;CeVIO&lt;/a&gt;. Today I stumbled on this video about Japanese speech synthesizers, and I thought it's very interesting. It begins introducing a few software that came first (MMDAgent and Open JTalk), then goes on to talk about the main topic, CeVIO. It demonstrates various voice samples (both for speech and for singing), and examples of how to edit the voices' parameters to read Japanese text. (it even has tips for those wanting to buy the software :D )&lt;/p&gt;

Here I'd like to share my progress, as well as a few tips for any visually impaired user that eventually decides to use VOCALOID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/accessibility-first-results-with-vocaloid/"&gt;more…&lt;/a&gt; (4 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Audio</category><category>VOCALOID</category><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/accessibility-first-results-with-vocaloid/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jun 2014 01:47:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Accessibility, and How I Began Using VOCALOID</title><link>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/accessibility-and-how-i-began-using-vocaloid/</link><dc:creator>Aiyumi</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What is VOCALOID?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's something that became quite popular in the last few years, but I had no idea of what it was until 2011. I just knew it had to do with music, and for a while I had thought it was the name of a band (hahahaha)! But no. VOCALOID is a singing synthesis software, paid and proprietary, whose engine is developed by Yamaha. The voices are provided by real people, mostly actors or singers. Each voice is represented by a character. The most popular one is Hatsune Miku (I don't like her very much) but there are many others. VOCALOID runs on Windows and Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For detailed information on all VOCALOID voicebanks available, visit the &lt;a href="http://vocaloid.wikia.com/"&gt;VOCALOID Wiki&lt;/a&gt; (which explains all this much better than me :P).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of songs with VOCALOID:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5kUd72R_tg"&gt;"Packaged", with the Hatsune Miku voicebank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0PmG_zQjy4"&gt;Natsu no Umi ("夏の海"), with the Kagamine Len and Kagamine Rin voicebanks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56Gk1Z1US0"&gt;"Cendrillon", with the VY2 and VY1 voicebanks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mL0n9zt7IdI"&gt;"Aitai" ("会いたい"), with the Megpoid/Gumi voicebank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w03Ld2T5MaU"&gt;"Greensleeves", with the Avanna voicebank (English)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdyO_vGX8KU"&gt;Cover of "Roda Viva", with the Galaco voicebank (forced to sing in Portuguese!)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;UTAU&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UTAU (meaning "to sing" in Japanese), is the name of another singing synthesis program, however it was developed by a fan. It's also proprietary, but is free (technically it's a shareware, but one of the few "advantages" of paying are just some interface improvements and maybe access to earlier test versions before the "general public", but it works for free with no problems). The voices are also provided by real people, with the difference that anyone can record his/her own voice and put it in the program without relying on contracts, studios and professional singers. So it has much more available voicebanks than VOCALOID, but the downside is that the quality varies greatly depending on the recording quality, the voicebank settings, the intonation and the pronunciation of the person who made the recording. UTAU has a version for Windows, and also one for Mac called UTAU Synth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of songs with UTAU:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPOfe-TA3YI"&gt;"Kenka Wakare" ("けんか別れ"), with the Momone Momo voicebank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP1uQNueWXA"&gt;"Error," with the Namine Ritsu Kire voicebank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRFuuxl3u3E"&gt;Cover of "Yuudachi no Ribon" ("夕立のりぼん"), with the Sukone Tei voicebank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon I began wanting to use the programs to make my own covers, and that was when the problems started. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/accessibility-and-how-i-began-using-vocaloid/"&gt;more…&lt;/a&gt; (7 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Audio</category><category>VOCALOID</category><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/accessibility-and-how-i-began-using-vocaloid/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2014 13:12:25 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
