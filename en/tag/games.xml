The game will be released for both PS3 and PS4 on September 15th, 2016 in Japan, and February 14th, 2017 in North America and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 3rd, 2016, a special Persona 5 anime episode aired in Japan to promote the game. It is titled, "Persona 5 the Animation - the Day Breakers," and is about the main gang doing a random sidequest (it's an optional mission that doesn't interfere with the main plot of the game. So, no worries about spoilers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/"&gt;Crunchyroll&lt;/a&gt; is a site that licenses and legally streams anime with English subtitles. It shares the money earned from its subscribers with the anime creators, and has also a selection of anime available to watch for free (although with ads interrupting the video from time to time :P ). The site made the Persona 5 special episode available for its subscribers on September 3rd, simultaneously as the anime's airing in Japan. One week later (on September 10th), the episode also became available for non-subscribers, and can be watched for free &lt;a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/persona5-the-animation-the-day-breakers-/episode-0-persona-5-the-animation-the-day-breakers-719079"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (no account or anything needed. Just enter the page and watch!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Games</category><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/watch-p5-db-online/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Sep 2016 00:36:45 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Getting Ready for Persona 5</title><link>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/getting-ready-for-persona5/</link><dc:creator>Aiyumi</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year (2015) I cleared the game Persona 3 FES (for Playstation 2), and in the beginning of this year (2016) I beat Persona 4 (also for PS2). An extremely brief introduction for those who don't know about these games: the Persona games are JRPGs (japanese RPGs) about high school students that need to balance studies, outings with friends, and fights against supernatural phenomena where they summon a kind of "inner self" in the form of creatures called "Persona." Both the Personas and the enemies are based on mythological beings, angels, demons and such. The games contain charismatic and well-developed characters, engaging storylines, and humorous scenes typical of anime. From Persona 3 onwards, the games have a calendar system where we follow the protagonists during the course of one year, where we can observe several aspects of Japanese culture such as typical foods (these games even made me &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/p3-food-ramen"&gt;try my hand at preparing ramen&lt;/a&gt;! :P ), some locations, and even what days are holidays on Japan's calendar! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/getting-ready-for-persona5/"&gt;more…&lt;/a&gt; (6 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Games</category><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/getting-ready-for-persona5/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2016 17:25:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>In the Mood to DASH, Reloaded!

Capcom hasn't shown any interest in continuing the series, but a few days ago, a light at the end of the tunnel came from somewhere else. Comcept, the company founded by Keiji Inafune (Rockman / Mega Man series' creator, who had left Capcom) launched a project to create a series that will become the spiritual successor to DASH/Legends. The project is called "RED ASH." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/in-the-mood-to-redash/"&gt;more…&lt;/a&gt; (12 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Games</category><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/in-the-mood-to-redash/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jul 2015 18:12:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Rockman DASH - "We are the Three Bonne Brothers" Violin Arrangements</title><link>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/bonnes-theme-arrange-2/</link><dc:creator>Aiyumi</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who have read my &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/gossec-gavotte-fvl-cover"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/virtual-violins"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; probably noticed that I'm currently obsessed with violins. It turns out that I couldn't resist and, in march of 2015, I began taking lessons to learn to play the real thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three months have passed, and I continue my &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/bonnes-theme-arrange-1"&gt;arrangements of the song "We Are the Three Bonne Brothers"&lt;/a&gt; from Rockman DASH/Mega Man Legends. Today I bring a few more versions, this time with violins, both the virtual one and the real one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These where made for my fan fiction, "&lt;a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10564022/1/Trigger-of-Change"&gt;Trigger of Change&lt;/a&gt;," where the Servbots learn to play the violin. The piano is the same as the &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/bonnes-theme-arrange-1"&gt;"Marimbonnes" version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the virtual one, made with the Embertone Friedlander Violin VST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download/listen: &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.opendrive.com/files/101759890_xIo2h_d1b5/bonnes-fvl01.ogg"&gt;bonnes-fvl01.ogg (OpenDrive)&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.4shared.com/mp3/wxHz8p3Qba/bonnes-fvl01.html"&gt;bonnes-fvl01.mp3 (4shared)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is my attempt at playing it with a real violin. Warning: beginner level playing (just three months of taking weekly lessons), and the intonation is still quite off. Also, it's my first time trying to record an acoustic instrument (recorded with a Zoom H4n portable recorder).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download/listen: &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.opendrive.com/files/101759900_0s6x3_4a1d/bonnes-realviolin01.ogg"&gt;bonnes-realviolin01.ogg (OpenDrive)&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.4shared.com/mp3/MJN7Xw8xce/bonnes-realviolin01.html"&gt;bonnes-realviolin01.mp3 (4shared)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three violins version: until I arrived at the final result above, I had to record the song over twenty times! I didn't want so many takes to go to waste, so I selected the better three of my recording (mis)takes and glued them together. The result is a trio of clumsy and out of tune Servbots.&lt;/p&gt;

I didn't know enough of either Japanese or English to be able to grasp it at the time I played, which was some 12 years ago. Turns out that I can't fully figure it out even now :P. I have the impression that the second game (the one with the major plot points) felt a bit rushed, some important things are mentioned only in passing and aren't expanded anywhere. After the cancellation of DASH/Legends 3, it's unlikely that we'll be seeing these answers anytime soon. I also noticed differences between the dialogue from the English version and the original Japanese (inconsistencies in the translation/usage of names and terms) which may affect how we view a characters personality, as well as parts of the plot itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, I still think it's a good plot, albeit a bit confusing and full of unexplored potential. That calls to one thing: fan fiction!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After checking the playthroughs, then reading a few discussions and fan fictions to see how other people interpret the plot, I was inspired to write my own fanfic, intitled "&lt;a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10564022/1/Trigger-of-Change"&gt;Trigger of Change&lt;/a&gt;". And like I did with my &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/pokemon/sl/drama"&gt;Pokemon fic&lt;/a&gt;, I began making Japanese anime style audio dramas out of it. This prompted the creation of a new &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/rockman"&gt;Rockman section&lt;/a&gt; on the site, with the page for the audio dramas &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/rockman/toc/drama"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude this post, I leave you with my VOCALOID cover of "Anata no Kaze ga Fuku Kara", the ending song to the first game. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did an arrangement of another music from Pokemon Black &amp;amp; White. It's the music titled "Ghetsis' Ambitions". Listen &amp;amp; download &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eUh9bHd7aM"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://gobblin.se/u/aiyumi/m/pokemon-bw-arrange-of-ghetsis-ambitions-motif-xf/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably this is where I'm most active at the moment. I never mentioned it here before, but for some time now, I've been writing a Pokemon Black &amp;amp; White fan fiction (in English). It's called &lt;a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8853146/1/"&gt;Soul Link&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm silently updating it regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did an audio drama adaptation of a scene from said fan fiction. The fanfic is in English, but the audio drama is in Japanese. The dialogue is mostly the same as the one from the fan fiction, so for those who understood the scene in the fic, the Japanese drama can probably be understood as well. A few people who like watching anime with Japanese audio might like it... Or not :P. Anyway, it can be found &lt;a href="https://gobblin.se/u/aiyumi/m/psl-ch004-true-plans/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It also uses the music arrangement I just mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I uploaded a few more sounds to &lt;a href="http://www.freesound.org/people/Aiyumi/"&gt;Freesound&lt;/a&gt;. I also added a lot of interesting sounds from other people to my &lt;a href="http://www.freesound.org/people/Aiyumi/bookmarks/"&gt;bookmarks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally got around to organizing my SlackBuilds for compiling Orca under Slackware and &lt;a href="https://github.com/aiyumi/slackware-scripts"&gt;uploaded them to Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit (2013-09-27): instructions on how to use the scripts now can be found &lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/installing-orca-on-slackware-14-0"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a 3DS XL. I wasn't thinking on doing that yet, but once again, I found a cheap one (for Brazil standards), and since prices in general are rising due to inflation, I decided to do it before it got too expensive. I won't make a full review like I did with the other one, but it suffices to say that compared to the normal 3DS, the buttons are more comfortable, the console is easier to hold (though a bit heavier) and the battery lasts more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mid July, my internet connection stayed down for nearly two weeks, affecting my work and everything. Calling the ISP only resulted in pointless excuses most of the time, and it took very long for them to have the will to send a technician here and fix it. It was a problem affecting the whole region where I live. Hopefully it's sorted out now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I've been listening a lot of Japanese music which uses singing synthesis software like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocaloid"&gt;VOCALOID&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utau"&gt;UTAU&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, a lot happened, as you can see. The problem is that I don't have the patience to write a full blog post for each thing I do, let alone in three languages... And I realized: isn't that the purpose of a microblog like Twitter? Right now, my Twitter isn't seeing much use aside from automatically alerting when I post something here. I'm thinking of making it update (preferably automatically) whenever I publish a fanfic chapter, or a Youtube video and maybe a few other things, so people can know I'm still active even if this blog isn't updated so often. The account is "&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aiyumi_en"&gt;@aiyumi_en&lt;/a&gt;". You can follow me, or if you're like me and aren't much into these social network things, you can use this &lt;a href="http://www.rssitfor.me/getrss?name=aiyumi_en"&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Audio</category><category>Fan-Made</category><category>Games</category><category>Site Updates</category><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/twitter-and-updates/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 22 Sep 2013 18:39:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Pokemon BW - Team Plasma's Theme Arrangement</title><link>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/plasma-theme-arrange-1/</link><dc:creator>Aiyumi</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I did an arrangement of Team Plasma's theme music, from the games Pokemon Black &amp;amp; White.

What?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't really know yet. But the point is... I bought a 3DS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-center" src="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/uploads/images/3ds-review/3ds-closed.jpg" width="320" height="240" alt="The 3DS with its lid closed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn't interested in any of its games in particular, but as my five years old DS Lite's buttons (mainly the arrow keys and the "A" button) are becoming loose, I was starting to consider doing an upgrade. My plan was to get the new console maybe next year, but I found a cheap 3DS in a store near home. "Cheap" in way of speaking, because here in Brazil, things like games are very expensive. My 3DS cost R$479 (roughly $236.70 USD). No, it's not the 3DS XL, it's the normal 3DS. And this was the cheapest brand new one I could find. The XL was just released here in Brazil, costing around... R$1200 (roughly $590 USD!). In other words, too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my review of the 3DS: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/nintendo-3ds-review/"&gt;more…&lt;/a&gt; (7 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Games</category><category>Site Updates</category><guid>http://aiyumi.warpstar.net/en/blog/nintendo-3ds-review/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Oct 2012 19:31:23 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
