The other day I came across [this blog post][theblogpost], pointing to [this video][thevideo], in which someone managed to play the Super Mario Bros' music on a printer! <!--teaser_end--> Very nice.

For those who couldn't listen to it, because of accessibility problems with the site's player or any other reason, [here is only the audio (in OGG format)][theaudio].
