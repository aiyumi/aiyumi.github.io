I've never thought that Windows errors could be so interesting. On [this page (in Japanese)][sourcepost], I've found the video below, where someone plays the theme song of "Revenge of Meta Knight" (from the Kirby series' games), with only the sounds of the Windows error messages!

The video begins with the system logon. Then, a program is executed and triggers a sequence of errors to form the music.

Attention: the video's creator warns you to get away from the screen while watching, because the video shows lots of flashing error messages that may be bad for the eyes.

If you can't see the video or just prefer to listen, here is only the [sound in OGG format][errorogg].
