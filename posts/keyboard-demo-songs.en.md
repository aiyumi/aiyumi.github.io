So far, I have owned three musical keyboards:

* A basic Casio which I don't remember the model anymore.
* A Fenix TG-8880D (Brazilian brand). It looked like a piano from outside, but its sounds and features weren't that impressive...
* And the Yamaha Motif XF, which is a beast (in a good way :P ).

The former two aren't here anymore, but the XF has been with me for seven years (I've already posted music arrangements using it here on the blog quite a few times). It has sounds that I like a lot, and many features I still haven't been able to master!

From the time I owned my first keyboard, I've always liked to listen to the demo songs. A few days ago, I wrote a post talking a bit about my keyboards and my appreciation for demo songs, also with some links for listening to demos of the Fenix keyboard, as well as a link to a Youtube channel I found with demos of a lot of other keyboards. I published the post on Steemit, and you can check it out on the link below:
