The legend says that when the kingdom was dominated by the evil being, a young man came traveling through time, defeated the dark forces and saved the kingdom, and since them he was known as the Hero of Time. This legend is right, but they forgot a very important detail: the Hero of Time was blind. <!--more-->

This is not so recent anymore, but it is still interesting.

With help from some gamers from the internet, a special walkthrough script was built. Using that, an emulator, save states and much perseverance, a young and blind man cleared the game "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time" (more details on [this article][zld] and [this video at CNN][cnn]). You can also check out the game playthroug by yourself, by going to his [Youtube channel][playlist].

PS: On my [article introducing game accessibility][a11y-intro], I said that the Pokemon games are very accessible. And it seems he agrees with me, because his channel has playthroughs of other games besides Zelda, with some Pokemon ones among them! Good to see I'm not alone in this.
