Just passing by to show I'm still around :P . It's been a few months since I last posted anything here, but I still update my fan fiction every month. To my surprise, I've also been managing to be active on Steemit, posting at least once a week (twice if we consider I usually publish the same post both in Portuguese and in English). Incidentally, my last Steemit post was about the accessibility problems that happen a lot with clickable HTML objects, which may be of interest to anyone visiting my blog to read about accessibility. Below is the link to the post:
