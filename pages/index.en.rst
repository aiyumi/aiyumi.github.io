Welcome to my site! This is a space dedicated to the various topics of my interest, such as the anime and game series I like, with music arrangements, fan fictions (mostly in English), and my attempts to adapt scenes from said fanfics into audio dramas in Japanese.

Even if I don't post anything on the site for months, I still update my fan fictions. There are new updates usually once or twice a month, and I always announce them on my `Twitter <https://twitter.com/aiyumi_en>`__.

Along the years, I have posted many articles on `my old blog </en/blog/>`__, and am continuing to post on my `blog on Hive <https://hive.blog/@aiyumi>`__, a social network with communities similar to Reddit, where the users' upvotes are worth cryptocurrency (usually just pennies, but hey, it's something!).
