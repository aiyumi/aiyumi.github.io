Welcome to my site! Here, you will find my blog where I post about various topics of my interest, as well as my pages dedicated to the anime and game series I like, with music arrangements, fan fictions (mostly in English), and my attempts to adapt scenes from said fanfics into audio dramas in Japanese.

Even if I don't post anything on the site for months, I still update my fan fictions. There are new updates usually once or twice a month, and I always announce them on my `Twitter <https://twitter.com/aiyumi_en>`__.
