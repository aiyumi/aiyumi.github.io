Welcome to my site! This is a space dedicated to the various topics of my interest, such as the anime and game series I like, with music arrangements, fan fictions (mostly in English), and my attempts to adapt scenes from said fanfics into audio dramas in Japanese. It also contains posts about computers, accessibility, Linux, my personal life and even some adventures in the kitchen.

Even if I don't post anything on the site for some time, I still update my fan fictions. There are new updates usually once or twice a month, and I always announce them on my `Twitter <https://twitter.com/aiyumi_en>`__.

I have posted many articles here along the years, but now, I do most of my blogging on my `Hive page <https://hive.blog/@aiyumi>`__. Hive is a social network. Hive has communities similar to Reddit, where the users' upvotes are worth cryptocurrency (usually just pennies, but hey, it's something!).
